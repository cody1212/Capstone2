For Greek food—a genre that’s a little sparse in Denver—Pete’s Central One is a mainstay. Wash Park West is also a great destination for Asian cuisine, and Thai Basil, although a chain, serves up the best green curry in that neighborhood.

It's very easy to access I-25 and go either to the Tech Center or Downtown if you're driving. No matter your background, all are welcome. Two thirds of the house is open plan encompassing the living room, dining areas and kitchen. The back of the house holds three bedrooms (one of which is a library/office currently) and two bathrooms. It's been renovated but mostly in keeping with mid-century modern aesthetics in mind. It feels like a loft but has the benefit of a garden complete with honeysuckle, tri-color beech tree, Rebud, Japanese Pagoda, Japanese Maples (which I haven't killed yet), Weeping Pussywillow, Japanese Iris and of course, herbs, tomatoes and zucchini in progress. During the summer, the house stays cool until around 3 p.m. (at which point I switch on the a/c or swamp cooler) even on days when it's 90 degrees outside.  It has a great patio to enjoy coffee","I'm sandwiched between two mid-century modern housing developments. To the north is ""Krisana Park""... A mid-century enclave that is fondly referred to as ""Leichler"" since it thinks it is ""like Eichler"". To the east is ""Lynwood""... Very similar houses and very much in demand. This house was built in 1958 and is one of a kind. Other stuff? We have an authentic french bakery two blocks away (Detour) as well as an independent coffee house: Sojourners. The bus route begins a block away. The Lightrail ""Colorado Station"" is a mile's walk and can take you either south to the Tech Center, east to DIA or north to Downtown Denver. Cherry Creek is about 10 mins by car and has great shopping, restaurants and movie theaters. If you love gourmet, niche pizza, we have a fantastic neighborhood bistro, ""Esters"" that opened about a year ago. Their nachos are mouth-watering. They have a few awesome salads, some sandwiches and of course, what most people go for... The pizza (and the craft beers).
